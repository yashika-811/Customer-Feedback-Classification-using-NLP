# Customer-Feedback-Classification-using-NLP

Project Overview

In today’s digital world, customers share their experiences through online reviews.
Reading thousands of reviews manually is difficult and time-consuming.
This project focuses on automatically analyzing customer feedback and classifying reviews into meaningful categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

Instead of traditional sentiment analysis, this project goes one step further by categorizing reviews into action-oriented classes that are useful for businesses.

Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Understand customer feedback automatically

Classify reviews into multiple business-relevant categories

Help organizations identify major problem areas and positive feedback quickly

Feedback Categories Used

Each customer review is classified into one of the following categories:

Product Quality Issue – Complaints related to product defects or performance

Delivery Issue – Late delivery, damaged packaging, or logistics problems

Service Issue – Customer support or service-related issues

Positive Feedback – Satisfied and happy customer responses

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of customer reviews similar to those found on Amazon and Flipkart

Reviews are short text sentences written by customers

Each review is manually labeled for learning and demonstration purposes

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Techniques Used:

Text Preprocessing

TF-IDF Feature Extraction

Logistic Regression (Multi-class Classification)

Project Workflow

Data Collection – Customer review samples are gathered

Text Cleaning & Preprocessing – Noise removal and normalization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Pattern and trend identification

Feature Extraction – Converting text into numerical form using TF-IDF

Model Training – Multi-class classification using Machine Learning

Evaluation – Model performance analysis

Result Storage – Final classified data saved as a CSV file

Key Insights

Most customer feedback falls under positive responses

Product quality and delivery issues are the most common complaint types

Negative feedback tends to be more detailed and longer in length

Text classification helps convert unstructured reviews into actionable insights

Real-World Applications

Customer feedback analysis for e-commerce platforms

Identifying recurring issues for product improvement

Enhancing customer service efficiency

Supporting data-driven business decisions
